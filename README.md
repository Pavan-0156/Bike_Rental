# 🚴‍♀️ Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This project aims to explore and predict bike rental demand based on historical data. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, we analyze factors influencing bike rentals and build predictive models.

## 📂 Project Overview

Bike-sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular across the world. This project explores a dataset from a bike-sharing service to identify patterns in rental behavior and forecast future demand.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
- Description: This dataset contains hourly and daily counts of rental bikes between 2011 and 2012 in Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C.
- Key features include:
  - `season`, `yr`, `mnth`, `hr`, `weekday`
  - `weathersit`, `temp`, `atemp`, `hum`, `windspeed`
  - `casual`, `registered`, and `cnt` (total count)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build predictive models to forecast bike rental demand
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R²

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost / Random Forest

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering and encoding
   - Train-test split

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing demand trends
   - Correlation analysis
   - Seasonal and weather impact on demand

3. **Modeling**
   - Regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Model tuning and evaluation

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: R² Score, RMSE, MAE
   - Feature importance

## ✅ Results

- The Random Forest and XGBoost models showed strong performance in predicting bike rental counts.
- Weather, hour, and temperature were among the most important features influencing demand.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series prediction)
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
